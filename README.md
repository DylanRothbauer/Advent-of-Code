# 🎄 Advent of Code - My Solutions Repository 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! This is where I share my solutions, code, and progress for the annual Advent of Code challenges. Each year, I participate in solving these exciting puzzles, which test problem-solving skills and logical thinking—all in the festive spirit of the holiday season!

## 📚 About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming event that runs from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, a new two-part coding puzzle is released, covering various programming concepts and algorithmic challenges. It's a fun and educational way to enhance coding skills and tackle interesting problems.

## 🛠️ Repository Structure
This repository is organized by year and then by day:
