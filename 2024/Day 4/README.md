### 📝 Part One: Finding XMAS
The first task was to count how many times "XMAS" appeared in the word search. Words could be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backward, or overlapping.

#### Example Word Search:
```
MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASX
```

#### Observations:
- All orientations were considered.
- Overlapping letters were allowed.

In the given example, **XMAS** appeared **18 times**.

#### Result:
The actual word search resulted in a total of **2569 occurrences** of XMAS.

### 📝 Part Two: Finding X-MAS Patterns
The second part introduced a new pattern called **X-MAS**, which is formed by two MAS written in the shape of an "X". Each MAS could be forward or backward.

#### Example Pattern:
```
M.S
.A.
M.S
```

#### Observations:
- Each MAS in the "X" could be reversed.
- Overlapping characters were allowed.

In the example word search, **X-MAS** appeared **9 times**.

#### Result:
The actual word search contained **1998 occurrences** of X-MAS.
